## About The Project

OrgVision is a sleek, modern dashboard designed to provide a single source of truth for organizational management. Built for a single administrator, it seamlessly integrates modules for **Finances**, **Human Resources**, and **Projects** into one cohesive experience.

From tracking inflows and outflows to managing staff profiles and visualizing project timelines on a Kanban board, OrgVision leverages a cutting-edge tech stack to deliver a fast, responsive, and visually stunning interface.

> Our philosophy is simple: complex organizational data doesn't require a complex interface. OrgVision is designed to bring clarity and control to your fingertips, in a package that looks and feels like the future of management software.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18+) or Bun
*   PostgreSQL database (A free tier on [Neon](https://neon.tech/) is recommended)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/orgvision-dashboard.git
    cd orgvision-dashboard
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    bun install
    # or npm install / pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Set up your environment variables:**
    *   Create a `.env` file in the root of the project by copying the `.env.example` file.
    *   Fill in your `DATABASE_URL` from Neon and any other required secrets.

4.  **Run database migrations:**
    *   Drizzle Kit will push the schema to your database, creating all necessary tables.
    ```sh
    bun db:push
    ```

5.  **Run the development server:**
    *   This will start both the backend API and the frontend React app with Hot Module Replacement (HMR).
    ```sh
    bun dev
    ```
    > Your application should now be running at `http://localhost:5173` (or the port specified by Vite).
